    <h1>BIO</h1>
    <p>
        My real name is Clark Estreller. I was born in November 18, 2006. I am from the Philippines. I started programming in 2016
        (when I was 9). After that, I made all sorts of (random) things with my knowledge. Back then, I had no way to share
        the random things I make. I just make things for my own, and just show it to my parents. Sometimes, I send the code
        to some of my classmates, but they don't know how to open the code. In late 2017, I learned about this platform called
        "Github". I discovered that I could share my projects with others, but back then I had no plan to make a Github account,
        but I got motivated in April of 2018. When I made an account, I further realized that with Github, you can receive
        comments and suggestions, from which I could be inspired from. I still couldn't remember why I was motivated to learn
        how to code, though.

        Please do not download this page on its own, as the links to the things I make may not function.
        <br />
        When you download this page with the other files in my repo, please place the other files in the same
        folder as this webpage, to ensure that the links work.

        One final reminder: do not move the other files out of their respective folders.
        Thanks.
